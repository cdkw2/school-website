# Combustion is a chemical process in which a substance reacts rapidly with oxygen and gives off heat. The original substance is called the fuel, and the source of oxygen is called the oxidizer. The fuel can be a solid, liquid, or gas, although for airplane propulsion the fuel is usually a liquid.
# Usually it happens with the a hydrocarbon or carbon fuel
# Such as methane gas

# Fission occurs when a neutron slams into a larger atom, forcing it to excite and split into two smaller atomsâ€”also known as fission products. Additional neutrons are also released that can initiate a chain reaction. When each atom splits, a tremendous amount of energy is released.
# For fission a radioactive isotope is necessary
# And the isotope is to be compressed to the critical mass of the object i.e the mass where nuclear fission starts

# Nuclear fusion is the process where two small atoms are heated up and fused together. The process involves a few basic steps: atoms are heated, the atoms collide with substantial force overcoming the coulomb force between them, the atoms fuse together, and a large amount of energy is released.
# This process however requires a large amount of temperature already to be present for this to work
