          Fire ecology is a branch of ecology that focuses on the origins of wildland fire and it's relationship to the environment that surrounds it, both living and non-living. A wildland fire is defined as any fire that is burning in a natural environment. Fire ecologists recognize that fire is a natural process, and that it often operates as an integral part of the ecosystem in which it occurs.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Fires are caused by natural or man-made fires in tropical, temperate and boreal forests. A wildfire must have three conditions in order to burn: fuel, oxygen and a heat source. Any flammable item surrounding a fire, such as trees, grasses, bushes and even dwellings, is considered fuel. The intensity of a fire is proportional to the amount of fuel present in a certain region. A fire requires oxygen to burn, which is provided by air. Heat sources aid in the ignition of the wildfire by raising the temperature of the fuel. Lightning, smoldering campfires or cigarettes, sweltering breezes and even the Sun can all ignite a wildfire.

    <h2>How is<span> it caused?</span></h2>
    <p>Approximately 90% of fires in the last decade have been human-caused, either through negligence, accident or intentional arson. Some of the fires caused by accidents and negligent acts are through unattended campfires, sparks, irresponsibly discarded cigarettes and burning debris. The remaining 10% of fires are caused by lightning strikes, which are especially prevalent in the Western United States and Alaska. In the 1930's, researchers in the southern United States argued against the negative perspective that has surrounded fire, with the belief that all fire is bad. It was realized that the devastating picture painted by huge-scale fires produced fear in the minds of the public (and in politicians and scientists alike), and that this generated detrimental results in response to any wildland fires.</p>

      <div class="block">
        <p>Approximately 54% of forests face occasional fires, 7.5% experience moderate fires, and 2.4% have high fire exposure. Around 36% of forests remain largely unexposed to significant fires.</p>

      <div class="block">
        <p>Lightning strikes the earth over 100,000 times a day. 10 to 20% of these lightning strikes can cause fire.</p>

        <p>From 2013 to 2022, there were an average of 61,410 wildfires annually and an average of 7.2 million acres impacted annually.</p>

    <p>Fire can cause soil damage, especially through combustion in the litter layer and organic material in the soil. This organic material helps to protect the soil from erosion. When organic material is removed by an essentially intense fire, erosion can occur. Heat from intense fires can also cause soil particles to become hydrophobic. Rainwater then tends to run off the soil rather than to infiltrate through the soul. This can also contribute to erosion. In actuality, the negative effects of fires on soils are often exaggerated, and many fairly intense fires in western United States forests cause little soil damage. There is also the potential for alien plants to become established after fire in previously uninfested areas.</p>

        <h2>Some more<span> information</span></h2>
        <p>Wildfire behavior and the effect of fire-exclusion policies on vegetation composition and structure varies considerably (Smith and Fischer 1997). A substantial amount of attention has been paid to the development of dense stockings of small trees in some forests, and the contribution thereof to current fire severity in those areas. Although this is generally true of drier vegetation ecosystems, this observation does not always apply to many of the wetter and colder forests that dominate much of the northern Rockies and the Pacific Northwest. Nor does it apply to non-forested areas. The frequency of fire historically varies considerably depending upon the type of vegetation in a given ecosystem. The ecological effects of wildfire suppression policies instituted in 1911 have also varied with vegetation type.
        </p>
        <p>Many dry coniferous forests have now missed several fire cycles (Mutch 1994). Due to their accessibility, these forests have also been extensively managed for timber production and livestock grazing. The ecological consequences of these management activities have caused a fairly dramatic change in tree density and forest composition (Smith and Fischer 1997). These changes have often created stands of dense, small-diameter trees in areas that used to be dominated by widely spaced old-growth trees. Past management activities have clearly created a situation in which a greater concentration of fuel is present, and there is a higher probability of high-intensity fire, should a wildfire spread into or start in the area.
        </p>
        <p>In contrast to the dry forests, subalpine forests composed mainly of subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia), Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) and whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) cover vast expanses of landscape. These forests are situated at higher elevations, which are considerably wetter and colder than the dry forests discussed above. Some of the conifer species present in sub-alpine forests are killed by moderate-intensity fire (Bradley, et al. 1992). In contrast, lodgepole pine, which is a dominant species in some sub-alpine forests, often reproduces prolifically following wildfire (Agee 1993). This is due to the serotiny of its cones. Some of the lodgepole pine cones are sealed shut by a resinous substance. These cones often remain on the tree for years at a time, and the seeds are only released when the resin is melted (at temperatures of 113-140 Â°F) during forest fires.
        </p>
        <p>Subalpine forests typically burn rather infrequently, though often at a much higher intensity than do dry forests. A few subalpine forest types (e.g. white-bark pine) experience more frequent fire (Smith and Fisher 1997) but are very limited in distribution (less than 18% of the sub-alpine forests in the northern Rockies). Historic fire-return intervals in subalpine forests range from 50 to 300 years (Arno 1980, Smith and Fisher 1997, Agee 1990, Agee 1993). In many cases, historic fire-return intervals for subalpine forests are longer than the period of time in which the current fire-exclusion policies have been in effect. Fire exclusion due to wildfire-suppression activities has not yet measurably altered the structure and composition of the subalpine forests since they have, in general, not missed fire cycles like the dry forests have. (Smith and Fisher 1997).
        </p>
        <p>In the northern Roackies, between the low-elevation dry forests and subalpine forests, a mid-elevation zone of forest, composed of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), grand fir (Abies grandis), subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia), red cedar (Thuja plicata), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), western larch (Larix occidentalis) and other species, is found. The fire regimes and historic fire-return intervals for these forests vary considerably with location and forest type (Arno 1980, Bradley, et al. 1992, Smith and Fischer 1997). Historic fire-return intervals range from 25 years to over 250 years in these stands (Arno 1980, Smith and Fisher 1997). Montane forests, generally, have been substantially affected by forest-management activities (primarily logging). These management activities and fire exclusion effects have largely varied within the diverse regions of montane forests in the western United States. In some areas, the effects have been subtle and slow to develop, while in other areas fire exclusion has lead to the development of dense understory vegetation and changes in forest composition (Smith and Fisher 1997).

    <h2>Beyond <span> the topic</span></h2>
    <p>Combustion is a chemical process in which a substance reacts rapidly with oxygen and gives off heat. The original substance is called the fuel, and the source of oxygen is called the oxidizer. The fuel can be a solid, liquid, or gas, although for airplane propulsion the fuel is usually a liquid. Usually it happens with the a hydrocarbon or carbon fuel. Such as methane gas.</p>

        <h4>Fusion</h4>
        <p>Nuclear fusion is the process where two small atoms are heated up and fused together. The process involves a few basic steps: atoms are heated, the atoms collide with substantial force overcoming the coulomb force between them, the atoms fuse together, and a large amount of energy is released. This process however requires a large amount of temperature already to be present for this to work</p>

      <div class="block">
        <h4>Fission</h4>
        <p>Fission occurs when a neutron slams into a larger atom, forcing it to excite and split into two smaller atomsâalso known as fission products. Additional neutrons are also released that can initiate a chain reaction. When each atom splits, a tremendous amount of energy is released. For fission a radioactive isotope is necessary. And the isotope is to be compressed to the critical mass of the object i.e the mass where nuclear fission starts</p>
